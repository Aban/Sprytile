            "text": "Quick Start Tutorial\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis is a short tutorial on how to install and use Sprytile, an open source tile map editor addon for Blender.\n\n\nWe'll be using the following tile set image for this tutorial, but feel free to use your own tileset to follow along.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\u00b6\n\n\nDownload the zip file from the \nSprytile page\n.\n\n\nIn Blender, open User Preferences by going to \nFile > User Preferences\n. Go to the Add-ons tab and press  \nInstall from File\n at the bottom of the preference window and navigate to the downloaded zip file. After installation, search for Sprytile under Community addons and enable it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture Uses\n\n\nPress the \nSave User Settings\n button if you want to continue using Sprytile in future Blender sessions without going back to User Preferences\n\n\n\n\nTo make sure Blender shows pixel art textures correctly, we have to turn off mipmaps in 3D view. In the preferences window, switch over to the \nSystem\n tab and turn off the Mipmaps option under OpenGL.\n\n\n\n\nWith Sprytile installed and setup, let's start a new Blender file by going to \nFile > New\n. Make sure the tool shelf panel to the left of the 3D view is open. If it is not, press \nT\n and find the Sprytile tab. If the Sprytile tab is missing, check the installation steps again.\n\n\nMaterial Setup\n\u00b6\n\n\nBefore using the Sprytile tools, the tile set has to be loaded into the material. With a mesh object selected, go to the Materials tab in the Properties View, then press \nSet Material to Shadeless\n in the Sprytile panel.\n\n\n\n\nNext, go to the Textures tab in the Properties view and load your tile set image into the material. After loading the image, go back to the Sprytile tab and press \nSetup Pixel Texture\n.\n\n\n\n\nSprytile Tools\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe majority of Sprytile's tools are accessed under \nEdit Mode\n. With a mesh object selected, enter edit mode and open the tool shelf to the Sprytile tab. Press \nT\n to open the tool shelf if it is hidden from the left of the 3D view. Expand the tool shelf if it is too cramped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPixel Density\n\n\nIf you're not using the provided tile set, you might want to change the world pixel density setting. This sets how many pixels fit inside one Blender unit. The provided tile set is based around 32x32 pixel tiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackface Culling\n\n\nIt is recommended to turn off backface culling so you can see the direction the faces are being built in.\n\n\n\n\nBuild Mode\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe build tool creates mesh faces that are UV mapped to the selected tiles. Open Sprytile's tile map mode by pressing the \nBuild\n button. You will notice the tile selection UI popup on the lower right corner of the 3D view, indicating that tile map mode is active.\n\n\nExit tile map mode by pressing the \nBuild\n button again or by pressing the \nEsc\n key. Pressing \nCtrl + Shift + Space\n on the keyboard will activate tile map mode again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTile Selection UI\n\n\nThe tile selection UI lets you pick the tile you will be painting with. Zoom the UI by hovering over it and scrolling your mouse wheel up or down.\n\n\n\n\nTile Building Workflow\n\u00b6\n\n\nNow to get familiar with Sprytile's workflow by building something! First, delete the existing vertices of the selected mesh so we have a blank slate.\n\n\nThe workflow of Sprytile revolves around Blender's 3D cursor and the direction the 3D view is facing.\n\n\nThe 3D cursor is the center of the tile grid when you're painting, and the global axis that the view is facing is the surface you will be painting on.\n\n\nAs an example, reorient the 3D view so that it is facing the floor of the file, and then set the 3D cursor to the center by pressing \nShift + S\n and selecting \nCursor to Center\n.\n\n\n\n\nIn the tile selection UI, choose the grass tile and paint around the 3D cursor. Notice how the tile grid is centered on the 3D cursor and the painting surface is oriented to the ground.\n\n\n\n\nNow reorient the 3D view so it is facing one of the side facing global axis. Pick a wall tile and paint with the tile. Notice how the tiles are being created on a grid centered on the 3D cursor but now in a perpendicular direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAxis Indicator\n\n\nWhile tile map mode is activated, the axis indicator in the Sprytile Painter panel will update to show you which axis the tiles will be painted on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the 3D cursor is an important part of the Sprytile workflow, you can quickly reposition the cursor to the vertex nearest the mouse cursor by holding down the \nS\n key while in tile map mode. To make navigation easier, pressing the \nW\n key will center the 3D view around the cursor.\n\n\n\n\nTry reorienting the 3D view to face the last axis you have yet to paint on, then moving the 3D cursor by holding down the \nS\n key and moving your mouse. Paint on that axis. Note that the center of the grid has moved to where you have positioned the cursor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeta software!\n\n\nSprytile is still in beta. If Sprytile stops responding during this tutorial, use the reset function under the utilities dropdown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTile Grids\n\u00b6\n\n\nNow that you know how to use Sprytile, let's focus on tile grids. Tile maps might be made up of tiles in different scales. To account for this, Sprytile allows you to paint tiles in different sizes. This part of the Sprytile panel allows you to create and organize the grid settings used in the tile map.\n\n\nPress the \n+\n button at the panel and select the newly created entry. The settings for this new tile grid can be changed in the boxes below. For this tile grid, lets change it to a 16 x 16 tile size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that the tile selection UI updates to show the currently selected tile grid as well. You can change the tile grid selection by using the tile grid selector in the tools panel.\n\n\nYou can also change tile grids by holding \nCtrl\n with your mouse over the tile selection UI and scrolling the mousewheel up or down.\n\n\n\n\nTile Flipping/Rotation\n\u00b6\n\n\nLooking closely at the last wall we created, we can see that the texture gets very repetitive. Delete part of that wall and recreate the wall using the 16x16 tile grid. By using the smaller grid, we can break up the pattern created by the larger tile size.\n\n\n\n\nBut even with the smaller tiles, the repetition is still visible. With tile map editors, you can further break up the patterns by rotating and flipping tiles. To do that, we use this part of the Sprytile panel.\n\n\n\n\nFor convenience, the keyboard shortcuts for rotating tiles left and right are the \n1\n and \n2\n keys. The \n3\n key toggles X tile flip, the \n4\n key toggles the Y tile flip. Repaint the wall using the tile flipping and rotation options.\n\n\n\n\nPixel Translate\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis wall is placed in an awkward position. Sprytile makes moving faces easier in tile map mode by constraining movement to the pixel grid. Select the wall faces and split them by pressing the \nY\n key. Now translate the selection by pressing the \nG\n key. The movement snaps to the pixel grid and a readout showing the movement is shown on the top left corner.\n\n\n\n\nBuild Mode Automerge\n\n\nIt's necessary to split the faces because build mode automatically merges close vertices by default. You can turn off this option by toggling \nAuto Merge\n beneath the tile rotation/flip section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe movement is restricted to the global axis the 3D view is facing. Use the pixel translation tool to move the wall to a more sensible place. Pixel translate is automatically used when in tile map mode, but can also be invoked manually outside of tile map mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnap Translate Vertices\n\n\nBy default, pixel translate will snap the selected vertices to the pixel grid around the 3D cursor. This can be turned off using the \nSnap Translate\n option in the Workflow panel.\n\n\n\n\nPaint Mode\n\u00b6\n\n\nFinally, we'll cover paint mode. Paint mode gives you tools to quickly UV map faces to tiles, allowing you to build your mesh with other Blender tools. Let's extrude the edges of the grass without using tile map mode so that the geometry isn't on the pixel grid anymore.\n\n\n\n\nNext, bring tile map mode into paint mode by pressing the \nPaint\n button in the Sprytile panel. Using the 32x32 tile grid, select the tile that is the border of the grass and the ground.\n\n\n\n\nNow try painting the tile on one of the extruded faces. The texture that appears is just the ground because the UV alignment is set to center. Change the alignment to top and try painting the faces again.\n\n\n\n\nNow the grass/ground boundary appears because UV mapping of the face is being aligned to the top of the tile. Continue painting the other extruded faces.\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Painting\n\u00b6\n\n\nPaint mode allows for easy UV mapping even when the face is not aligned to the global XYZ axis. Using the create tab, make a low poly\ncylinder and rotate it so it is not aligned to the global XYZ axis.\n\n\n\n\nSwitch to the 16x16 tile grid and select the following tile. Make sure that grid rotation is back at 0 and that Flip X and Y are off.\n\n\n\n\nIf you try painting the cylinder faces, you will notice that the alignment of the UV is not correct. To fix this, we can use hinting mode. Toggle on hinting in the Sprytile panel.\n\n\n\n\nSwitch to edge selection mode and select one of the cylinder's edges along the long side. Then paint on the faces connected to the selected edge and notice that the UV mapping is now properly aligned to the face.\n\n\n\n\nWhat hinting does is indicate to Sprytile which side of the face will be aligned to the horizontal axis of the tile map.\n\n\nThe cylinder still doesn't look like our selected tile. To fix this, we can use the stretch options.\n\n\n\n\nWith the stretch options on, repeat painting the faces like with the previous step. Now the faces will be UV mapped with the selected tile stretched out over it, looking more like a the metallic pipe of the selected tile.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis tutorial gives an overview of Sprytile's basic functions, hopefully enough to help you to build cool things with it. A video version of this tutorial will be coming soon.\n\n\nSee the individual topic pages for a more in-depth view of Sprytile's functionality.\n\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to contact me on \ntwitter\n or via the \ndiscussion boards\n.",
